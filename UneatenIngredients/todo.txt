--> Application to test table / collection configurations (not too much because UIKit will be replaced soon)
- Categories : to test action, add isFavorite check on the cell

- On top of collection :
-- View controller to add category with timer to see animation

- Add configuration to datasource (config struct) : configure the application of changesets

Notes :
reloading items in section :
Done naively, the sections headers don't animate as they should. Possible solutions :
- reload of full section when a cell is reloaded (not chosen because not right on paper and may lose scrolling on some layout)
- perform empty batch update right after the first one : cheap trick.
